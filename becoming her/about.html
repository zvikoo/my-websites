<hi>WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO BECOME THE BEST VERSION OF YOURSELF?</h1>
<p>Becoming the best version of yourself means getting back to your quintessential self. As straightforward as that sounds, it’s anything but: Authentic self-discovery takes courage and tenacity. To approach your essential self, you must turn away from distracting false beliefs that cloud or distort your self-perception.

If you’re feeling anxious about self-improvement, remember: every person is completely unique. Someone else’s life path cannot be your benchmark of success, since they have different dreams, passions and skills. There is also no roadmap or ideal outcome in life, because everyone’s path is theirs and theirs alone.</p>

<h1>DISCOVERING WHO YOU REALLY ARE</h1>
<p>Before you can be the best version of yourself, you must uncover your essential “you-ness” – the values, interests and passions that define who you are in life and the world. Have a conversation with yourself just like you’d have on a first date. Pretend that your ideal self is sitting there with you and ask that person: What activities do you enjoy? Who do you enjoy being around? What impact do you want to make on the world? What is your happiest memory? Be sincere and honest in your answers.

As you continue the conversation, pay attention to your feelings. If you notice “negative” emotions like anxiety or anger, you’re probably telling yourself subtle negative messages that obscure your conversation. Dig deeper into what’s driving the feeling. Are you afraid you’ll fail at finding yourself? Are you afraid of what you’ll find when you dig deep?

 As tempting as it is to feel inadequate, the truth is that each of us is fully complete just the way we are. It’s getting in touch with this essential self that will free you to become the best version of yourself.<p/>
